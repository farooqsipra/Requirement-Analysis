## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis in Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is the process of examining, understanding, and clarifying software requirements before development and testing begin.

It ensures that all functional and non-functional expectations are clearly defined, testable, and traceable.

## Why It Is Important

- Prevents defects early
- Helps in writing accurate test cases
- Avoids rework and reduces project costs
- Improves team communication


## Steps of Requirement Analysis

1. **Collect Requirements**
   Gather from SRS, user stories, or meetings with stakeholders.

2. **Understand Requirements**
   Clarify the purpose, expected input/output, and scope.

3. **Identify Gaps or Missing Info**
   Raise queries for ambiguous or conflicting requirements.

4. **Categorize Requirements**
   Functional (features) and non-functional (performance, usability).

5. **Prioritize for Testing**
   Focus on core features and high-risk areas.

6. **Start Test Design**
   Use the requirements to begin creating test cases and test data.


## Types of Requirements in QA

### Functional Requirements
These define **what the system should do**.
- Example: "User can reset password via email link."

### Non-functional Requirements
These define **how the system should behave**.
- Example: "Login page should load in less than 2 seconds."

## User Story

"As a user, I want to log in using my email and password so I can access my dashboard."

### QA Analysis
- Positive: Valid email and password
- Negative: Invalid email/password, empty fields
- Edge Cases: Special characters in input, SQL injection attempt
- Questions: Should 'Remember Me' be tested?
